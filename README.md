# Object-Oriented Software Engineering and Design Projects - The University of Texas at Arlington, School Project

This repository contains the deliverables from the **Object-Oriented Software Engineering and Design** course, developed as part of a **team project**. These projects demonstrate the application of software engineering principles, design patterns, and object-oriented programming to solve real-world problems effectively. It includes comprehensive documentation, UML modeling, and implementation of various use cases.

## Team Contributions
This project was completed as a collaborative effort, with all team members contributing to brainstorming, design, and implementation tasks.

## Use Cases

### 1. Edit Booth Floor Plan
- **Description**: Developed a system for creating and editing event booth floor plans to optimize layout functionality and traffic flow.
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic booth placement and layout refinement.
  - Applied **Composite**, **Flyweight**, and **Iterator** design patterns to enable scalable and reusable components.
  - Save and load functionality to persist changes.
  - Produced **UML class diagrams**, **sequence diagrams**, and **design class diagrams** to define attributes, methods, and relationships.
- **Outcome**: Delivered an interactive tool for floor plan management, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

### 2. Update Discount Policy
- **Description**: Designed a Discount Policy Editor to create, modify, and manage discount rules for products and services.
- **Key Features**:
  - Supported multiple discount types, including percentage, fixed amount, and conditional discounts.
  - Used **Command**, **Interpreter**, and **Chain of Responsibility** design patterns to process and validate discount rules.
  - Implemented role-based access controls for secure modifications.
  - Documented use case interactions through **sequence diagrams**, **design class diagrams**, and UML models.
- **Outcome**: Created a secure and flexible solution for managing discount strategies.

### 3. Analyze Booth Lease Status
- **Description**: Built a tool to analyze booth leasing statistics, categorized by size and type.
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time computation and visualization of booth availability and rental percentages.
  - Utilized **Controller**, **Iterator**, **Composite**, and **Visitor** design patterns for efficient data processing.
  - Developed comprehensive **UML class diagrams**, **sequence diagrams**, and **design class diagrams** to align attributes, methods, and relationships with functional requirements.
- **Outcome**: Enabled efficient data analysis and reporting of booth lease status.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- **UML Modeling**: Designed and documented systems using **class diagrams**, **sequence diagrams**, and **use case diagrams**.
- **Design Patterns**: Applied **GoF design patterns**, such as:
  - **Composite**, **Flyweight**, **Iterator**, **Visitor**, **Command**, **Interpreter**, and **Chain of Responsibility**.
- **Deriving System Components**: Identified and derived attributes, methods, and relationships from functional requirements to ensure robust system design.
- **Team Collaboration**: Strengthened teamwork and communication skills through distributed development and iterative design processes.
- **Scalability and Maintainability**: Focused on creating solutions that align with domain-driven design principles.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Design Tools**: UML for modeling (class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and use case diagrams).
- **Design Patterns**: Composite, Flyweight, Command, Visitor, Iterator, Interpreter, Chain of Responsibility.
- **Collaboration**: Team-based project with shared ownership and iterative development.
